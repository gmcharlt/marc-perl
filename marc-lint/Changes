        [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
        - updated DATA to incorporate MARC update 5 (Oct. 2004)

        - check_245( $field ) updated:
         - Makes sure $a exists (and is first subfield).
         - Warns if last character of field is not a period
         -- Follows LCRI 1.0C, Nov. 2003 rather than MARC21 rule
         - Verifies that $c is preceded by / (space-/)
         - Verifies that initials in $c are not spaced
         - Verifies that $b is preceded by :;= (space-colon, space-semicolon,
         space-equals)
         - Verifies that $h is not preceded by space unless it is dash-space
         - Verifies that data of $h is enclosed in square brackets
         - Verifies that $n is preceded by . (period)
         -- As part of that, looks for no-space period, or dash-space-period
         (for replaced elipses)
         - Verifies that $p is preceded by , (no-space-comma) when following $n
         and . (period) when following other subfields.
         - Performs rudimentary check of 245 2nd indicator vs. 1st word of 245$a
         (for manual verification). This could use some reworking, and was
         developed based on a predominantly English collection. Uses the
         internal _check_article( $field ) method.

        - added _check_article( $field ) internal method for comparing
         nonfiling indicator against first word of title field
        - added check245.t to test the new check_245 functionality

        - updated lint.t to use File::Spec for path to camel.usmarc
        - removed updir usage so 'make test' works properly

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - added check for subfield delimiters in fields lower than 010
         - updated lint.t and camel.usmarc with a test for this new code

        - added check_020( $field ):
         - uses Business::ISBN to validate 020$a and 020$z ISBNs. The current
         version needs work for ISBN-13 checking. Uses an internal sub,
         _isbn13_check_digit($ean) to validate 13 digit ISBNs, based on code in
         Business::ISBN. Checking of subfield z needs work (it is currently
         written for nonstandard practice).

        - added check020.t to test the new check_020 method
        
        - added check_041( $field ):
         - warns if subfields are not evenly divisible by 3 unless second
         indicator is 7
         (future implementation would ensure that each subfield is exactly 3
         characters unless ind2 is 7--since subfields are now repeatable. This
         is not implemented here due to the large number of records needing to
         be corrected.).
         - validates against the MARC Code List for Languages
         (L<http://www.loc.gov/marc/>) using the MARC::Lint::CodeData data pack
         
        - added check_043( $field )
         - warns if each subfield a is not exactly 7 characters.
         - validates each code against the MARC code list for Geographic Areas
         (L<http://www.loc.gov/marc/>) using the MARC::Lint::CodeData data pack

        - added check041043.t to test the new check_041 and check_043 methods

        - check_record() now accepts any isa( 'MARC::Record' ).

        - _check_article() no longer trips a Perl warning if an indicator
          has a non-numeric value.
        
        - _check_article() updated with exceptions for 'a posteriori' and 'a priori'
        
        -Replaced indenting tabs with 4 spaces
        
        -marclint utility updated to report errors encountered while translating raw MARC records into MARC::Record objects.
        
1.40    Mon Dec 20 14:01:53 CST 2004
        - added DATA for tags 001-008
        - updated DATA to incorporate update 4 (Oct. 2003)
        - corrected errors in the DATA section

1.39    Thu Dec 16 20:25:41 CST 2004
        - initial baseline release after separation from MARC::Record proper
