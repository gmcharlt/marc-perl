MARC::Record version 0.08
=========================

SYNOPSIS

The MARC::Record and MARC::Field modules allow a simple, object-based
interface to MARC records.  For example, the following program reads
through a USMARC file and prints the title, followed by any/all
subject tags.

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w

  use strict;
  use MARC::Record;

  use MARC::Record;


  open( IN, "<", $filename ) or die "Couldn't open $filename: $!\n";
  binmode( IN ); # for the Windows folks
  while ( !eof(IN) ) {
      my $marc = MARC::Record::next_from_file( *IN );
      die $MARC::Record::ERROR unless $marc;


      # Print the title tag
      print $marc->subfield(245,"a"), "\n";


      # Find any subject tags and print their _a subfields
      for my $subject ( $marc->field( "6XX" ) ) {
          print "\t", $subject->tag, ": ", $subject->subfield("a"), "\n";
      } # for subject
  } # while

  close IN or die "Error closing $filename: $!\n";
