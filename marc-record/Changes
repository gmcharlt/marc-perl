Revision history for Perl extension MARC::Record.

0.92    April 2, 2002
	- Fixed marclint to use the new MARC::File object

0.91	April 2, 2002
	- Fixed a bad build: MARC::Batch wasn't included in the tarball.

	- marcdump now takes a --lif parm to be able to dump MicroLIF
	records.

0.90	April 1, 2002
	- Alpha version of what will become MARC::Record 1.00.

	- MAJOR infrastructure changes.  Scripts WILL break.

	- The file-handling has been removed from the MARC::Record class
	and moved into its own MARC::File::* set of classes.

	- First rudimentary MARC::Batch functionality.  This will make
	it easy to handle bunches of files at once without having to
	muck with what file you're on.

	- Now fully embracing all the glory of 5.6+ Perl, such as the
	"our" keyword and $fh filehandles.

0.15	March 19, 2002
	- Added clone() methods for MARC::Field and MARC::Record, so
	you can make a copy of an existing record.  Plus, this acts
	as a filter to create records that are subsets of another.
	
	- Added selective printing of fields in marcdump.  Now you
	can do something like this:

	    marcdump myfile.marc --field=245 --field=1XX

	and only get back the title and author fields

0.14	March 7, 2002
	- Added skip_from_file() to read and ignore a record.  It's the
	same as next_from_file(), without the overhead of the parsing.

0.13    November 18, 2001
	- MARC::Lint now squawks if there are inappropriate control
	  characters in the data.

0.12	November 13, 2001
	- new_from_microlif() now allows underscores that are embedded in a
	  subfield, and ignores any HDR line that gets passed to it.

0.11	November 12, 2001
	- Added inbound microlif support.
	- Added lif2marc program.

0.10	September 27, 2001
	- Correctly updates the base address in the leader.  Thanks to
	Tim Wentz (twentz@mc.net) for finding & fixing.

0.09	August 9, 2001
	- Updated rules from "Understanding MARC" book.
	- Added delete_field() method.

0.08	May 25, 2001
	- Added MARC::Record::title and ::author methods
	- Added the marclint program.
	- Added the rest of the rules for the 5XX tags forward.
	- Made the modules compatible with Perl 5.004.  The exception
	  is MARC::Lint, which requires 5.005 because of the qr//
	  operator.
	- as_string() methods now return raw strings, without any special
	  formatting.  To get the formatted strings from versions <=0.07,
	  use as_formatted().

0.07	May 22, 2001
	- Added the rudimentary MARC::Lint module.
	- Added parms to marcdump program

0.06	May 16, 2001
	- Added marcdump program as demo and actual useful code

0.05	May 16, 2001
	- Created t/camel.t as the basis for a test suite. 
	- Removed the MARC::Field::subfields() method
	- Documentation cleanup.

0.04	May 15, 2001
	- Sped up the MARC::Record and MARC::Field constructors about 30%.

0.01	Apr 20, 2001
	- First version.
